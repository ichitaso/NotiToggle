# NotiToggle - banner notifications toggle for SBSettings
**Internals:** When a notification comes in, if the toggle is off, the banner's hidden by not running `%orig` in the notification displaying method. This still allows it to appear in the NC.

[MIT licensed](http://adam.mit-license.org), as usual.

_Note that I won't be releasing this tweak on a stock Cydia repo, as there are already many similar tweaks (albeit none are SBSettings toggles). You can get it from my repo: **hbang.ws**_
